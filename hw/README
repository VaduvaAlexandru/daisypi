DaisyPi_HA
==========

The implementation on this git repository tries to be a conversion 
of the old available code using bash and c language and trying to 
offer a better performance by avoiding the use of third party 
libraries.

The old code was available thanks to Rares Plescan. 
Thanks to him we had the stepping stone for the Daisy Pi project 
and we can continue the search for offering better performances for 
our product, and even different implementation for the same device.
