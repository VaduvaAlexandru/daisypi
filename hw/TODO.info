Urgent:
    change exacutable names for mcp, led and tsl accordingly.
        Example:mcp3208_read, led_read, tsl235r_read.
    all the other ones should have the same pattern
    a similar makefile target like archivate/delarchive should be created
        but it will only contain an archive with execs from apps.

Done list:
    mcp3208 - c driver (uses spidev).
    ePIR    - bash code (faster then the previous python implementation).
    bmp085  - c code for bmp085 board updated format.
    led     - updated code with native c implemenation.
    adxl345 - offer the same design to Rares`s version because is better.
    adxl345 - tried  a new implementation to obtain a better performance. Remain as backup.
    sht11   - replace bcm2835 library with native code.
    tsl235r - replace bcm2835 library with native code.

TODO list:
    adxl345 - test both implementations.
    Replace bcm2835 library with native code.
    Test all the application on DaisyPi.
    Format the file name correspondingly.

Obsolete list:
    ePIR    - became obsolete because the ePIR is not as easy to get.
            - maybe a C code will be written for him for better performance.

Information:
    adxl345 - started working on it but I have some problems. Not sure if it is a hardware or a software problem.
            - meanwhile I will start porting Rares`s version.
            - believe it is a hardware problem because also Rares`s version did not work.
    Working on autotools implementation for the projects:
            - it proved to be not as easy to understand for further development
    Proposed a new format based on a master Makefile:
            - include all the necessary modules into the MODULE variable
            - new modules are added very easy and they only need a Makefile with the follwong targets:
                    -- all
                    -- clean
                    -- distclean
            - all the new added modules can inspire from already existing modules
