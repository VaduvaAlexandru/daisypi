both setup and devel related.


1. Expanded filesystem
2. Installed midnight commander
3. Installed bc ( math cli utility )
4. Created folder /daisypi (main installation folder for the project )
5. Created customized examples from Adafruit/modified by http://www.john.geek.nz/ for I2C sensors ( SHT11 and BMP085 ).
